    Hello! I'm <strong>Roth Samnang Visothipong</strong>, a Full-Stack Developer and EdTech Innovator currently based in Hasselt, Belgium.

    I'm a highly motivated and results-oriented Full-Stack Developer with over 3 years of experience designing, developing, and deploying scalable web and mobile applications.

    What drives me is leveraging technology to create impactful, user-friendly educational solutions. My proudest achievement is leading the development of the <strong>GEIP EdTech App</strong>, a government-backed platform supported by Cambodia's Ministry of Education (MoEYS) that has empowered over 400,000 students in Cambodia, serving 20,000 daily active users across 1,861 schools.

    I'm passionate about modern technologies including React Native, Next.js, Flutter, Firebase, and cloud services. I also enjoy training and mentoring junior developers, having served as a Mobile App Teacher for React Native.

    Currently pursuing my Master of Education at Hogeschool PXL in Belgium while continuing to contribute to innovative EdTech projects. I believe in the power of technology to transform education and improve lives.
